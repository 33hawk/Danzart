              for being Ballet an excellent and comprehensive form of exercise that promotes good health and emotional well-being.
              In Ballet exercises every muscle is engaged in movement, while broad areas of the brain are utilized to develop
              balance (to perform fluid movement), artistry (to interpret music) and memory (to learn steps). Additionally,
              classical music played in ballet class encourages alpha wave development, enhancing creativity and combating
              depression.
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">Due to the tremendous benefits in terms of health and emotional well-being it brings with it, more and more adults
              over the world are taking ballet lessons nowadays as an alternative to other forms of exercise. DanzArt’s Adult
              Balletic Programs encompass the perfect blend of deep muscle toning with resistance, the grace of Ballet, the
              flexibility of Yoga and the core strengthening of Pilates. The programs are specifically designed to fulfill
              the varied needs of adult students, regardless of their age, sex, appearance or dancing skills, providing something
              for everyone, from beginners to advanced, in a supportive, demanding and enjoyable atmosphere to sheer the

            <h4 class="title">Adult Recreational Ballet Classes</h4>
            <p class="text">Unlike many forms of fitness exercises, Ballet is a complete discipline involving the body, mind and creative
              expression of the individual. It is an art form and a discipline where the dancer can immerse in the beauty
              of the music and enter another world. The student will probably find that the physical benefits gained will
              quickly become secondary to the sheer beauty and joy of dance that he/she will experience.</p><br>

            <p class="text">Beginner classes are conceived for those students who over the years have harbored a secret desire to dance Ballet,
              but never stepped foot inside a ballet studio or for those who have a basic understanding of the foundations
              of Ballet. Students’ ages may range from late teens onwards and the classes concentrate on understanding and
              improving proper alignment, posture, rotation, flexibility, and coordination, while learning all the basics

              an absence of many years or those who have always danced non-professionally. These classes uses the full range
              of Classical Ballet technique and move at a much quicker pace, offering increased technique and balletic expression,
              as well as more complex combinations both at the barre and in the center.</p>

              in the feet, ankles and legs, while developing the ability to control the balance on pointe.</p><br>
            <hr><br>
            <h4 class="title" id="character-dance">Character Dance</h4>
            <p class="text">It is a specific subdivision of Classical Ballet, being the stylized representation of traditional folk or national
              dances, mostly from European countries, which have been adapted for the theater. Dancers will have the opportunity
              to explore and learn folk dance steps from many popular national dances of Hungary, Russia, Poland, Italy,
              and Spain -Czardas, Mazurka, Tarantella, Russian, Flamenco…-, while developing rhythm and syncopation skills
              and learning body placement, the use of the torso and épaulement.</p>
            <p class="text">Although character dances can seem more relaxed and easier than classical choreography and are an often-overlooked
              aspect of dance training, in reality they entail complex upper-lower body opposition, épaulement and heel-toe
              footwork and in many cases can be much sharper and faster than classical ballet. But the form isn’t just for
              extreme classicists. They also help dancers gain a deeper understanding of story ballets, boost their coordination
              and musicality and make them use their body in a completely different way to become a versatile dancer. It’s
              essentially a form of cross-training that can enhance classical and contemporary technique alike.
            </p>
            <p class="text">At DanzArt Studio Character dances are taught to students beginning with the basic skills of coordination and
              style of European folk dances. As students develop in their dance training, character dance becomes a perfect
              blend between technical skill and emotion portrayed in their dance performances.</p><br>

            <h4 class="title" id="adap">Adaptive Ballet for Children & Youngsters With Special Needs</h4><img class="responsive-img" src="images/specials.jpg"
              alt="special-needs">
            <p class="text">Many children and youngsters with disabilities cannot succeed in a traditional ballet class setting and thus
              are excluded from all the benefits that ballet classes can bring – self-confidence, friendships, self-discipline,
              and the joy of movement. This program is tailored to assist children with special needs to learn the technique
              and discipline of ballet and reap its many benefits, using the Schlachte Method™.</p><br>
            <h4 class="subtitle">The Schlachte Method™</h4><img class="responsive-img" src="images/methodarea.jpg" alt="Schlachte">
            <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ is a ballet-base therapy developed in the United States by Bonnie Schlachte and proven
              successful in teaching of ballet to children within the autism spectrum, children with learning and developmental
              disabilities, children with anxiety disorders, behavioral issues, ADHD, blind, deaf, and children who are non-ambulatory
              as well as neuro-typical children.</p><br>
            <p class="text">This method believes that every child has abilities that can be used as a springboard to learn new skills and
              enhance each child’s personal sense of accomplishment. Therefore, the methodology uses a wide variety of teaching
              styles to accommodate all modes of learning and to strengthen each skill set area in all children.</p><br>
            <p class="subtitle">Visual Learning</p><img class="float-pics" src="images/visual-learning.jpg" alt="visualLearning">
            <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ employs various visual teaching methods to assist the visual learner and teach visual learning
              skills. Each class utilizes a visual schedule to assist the child with sequencing and moving from exercise
              to exercise. All personal work areas are clearly designated and color-coded so that children can focus on the
              exercises and know their personal-space boundaries. All exercises are done in front of mirrors to allow children
              the opportunity to see themselves and to correct their movement when necessary. Each class has an accompanying
              DVD that the students are expected to watch twice a week between classes. The DVD displays all the visual images
              used in class to assist with proper ballet technique (i.e. your foot needs to brush the floor with your leg
              straight in a tendu so the children see a broom taped to a leg with the foot “sweeping” away ash), and shows
              children doing each exercise.</p><br>
            <p class="subtitle">Auditory Learning</p>
            <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ utilizes classical ballet music that was specifically composed for each class. All music
              was composed to assist the auditory learner and to teach the auditory skill of timing (when to move) and what
              emotion is being expressed. Likewise, all music was composed to correlate with the images and the story being
              told in the DVD. As part of the auditory learning process, the teacher sings (instead of speaking or counting
              out) each exercise to assist the children in learning the proper combinations.</p><br>
            <p class="subtitle">Vestibular Learning</p><img class="responsive-img" src="images/vestibular.jpg" alt="vestibularLearning">
            <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ is primarily based on full body movement. It focuses on every part of the body from facial
              expressions to the tips of the fingers and toes. There are specific exercises in every class designed to assist
              the children in learning to express emotions through facial expressions, learning to feel movement through
              the tips of their fingers and toes, and learning to work with the spine (how to curve and straighten it). This
              method also assists each child in learning body awareness and physical coordination. Also, each class requires
              various energy levels (depending on the exercise) teaching the children how to regulate their energy levels
              depending upon the exercise requirements. Likewise, these exercises teach spatial awareness through the designated
              spaces on the floor and through combinations completed with other students.</p><br>
            <p class="subtitle">Emotional Intelligence</p><img class="responsive-img" src="images/inteligenciaemocional.jpg" alt="emotionalInteligence">
            <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ teaches emotional intelligence through various means. The first step in emotional intelligence
              is the ability to identify emotions. This method teaches children to identify anger, happiness, sadness, surprise,
              etc. through body movements, musicality, and facial expressions. This method also utilizes story to express
              emotions. Each exercise has a story that corresponds with the movement and emotions. Children will be told
              the story and then be taught to express it through movement and facial expression. As part of this method the
              children will be taught in a safe and structured environment so that they can focus on expressing themselves
              emotionally without any anxiety or fear. The DVD works to prime the child so that the child knows exactly what
              is expected in class to alleviate any surprises. The visual schedule assists with reducing anxiety helping
              the child know what exercise is next and when class will be ending. Any changes to the class structure are
              told to the child beforehand to prepare them for that which is different. Likewise, any sensory distractions
              in the studio will be minimized to help the child focus more easily on the ballet instruction.</p>

              specific technical difficulties, bad habits and faults, work on specific weaknesses, polish technique, and
              refine artistry.</p><br>

            <h4 class="title" id="barre-a-terre">BARRE Á TERRE</h4>
            <p class="text">The Barre á Terre Program is based around typical ballet-type movements and designed to provide participants
              of any age, skill or experience, dancers and non-dancers, a complete workout to improve their overall physical
              fitness and dance technique.</p><br>
            <p class="text">
              Barre á Terre classes cover a range of strengthening and stretching exercises performed supine, lying on the side, prone
              and seated and sequenced together to form a short routine. Through a set of exercises the class will help students
              to work the muscles deeply and intelligently, achieve proper placement and pelvic alignment, strengthen the
              core, elongate the muscles, and overcome any weaknesses, providing as well a solid foundation in body awareness
              that can be applied in the daily activities. Additionally, the stretching routine incorporated in the program
              will increase flexibility and the range of motion in joints, thus reducing the risk of muscle, tendon and joint
              injury, preventing muscle soreness and stiffness, and improving balance.
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">
              Particularly for dancers, this program will enable them to increase turnout, develop strength and stability on the standing
              leg and better understand, work in depth and add smoothness to certain dance movements, being also an excellent
              aid in injury recovery and prevention.
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">Among its countless benefits:</p><br>
            <p class="text">- It corrects placement of the pelvis, hips and back, strengthens muscles and joints, and tones the abdominal
              area without the pressure of gravity.</p><br>
            <p class="text">- It is a gentle and effective method that lengthens and strengthens muscles, releasing tension from neck and
              joints.
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">- It concentrates in body alignment and improves the efficiency of muscles, allowing correction of bad structural
              habits and improving balance.</p><br>
            <p class="text">- It is an extremely safe, low impact program traditionally adopted by professional ballet dancers during periods
              of injury.</p><br>
            <p class="text">- It increases flexibility and the range of motion in joints, reducing the risk of muscle, tendon and joint injury
              and preventing muscle soreness and stiffness.</p><br>
            <p class="text">- It is a holistic approach to center the mind while sculpting and refining the body.</p><br>

            <h4 class="title" id="ball-progressing">Progressing Ballet Technique</h4>
            <p class="text">This is a complementary course to the regular dance class, which allows the student to focus on the essential
              muscular groups that a dancer needs to focus on. This technique is designed to help dancers understand the
              depth of training muscle memory, core strength, stability and alignment, educate them on their own strength's
              and weakness plus build a knowledge base of their anatomy. The goal of this class is to help a dancer be the
              strongest and most intelligent dancer they can be.</p>

            <h4 class="title" id="kinetics">Dance Kinetics</h4><img class="responsive-img" src="images/kinetics.jpg" alt="kinetics">
            <p class="text">Dance kinetics is strongly influenced by the Eric Franklin Method that uses visualization, dynamic imagery, biomechanical
              principles of the human anatomy in dancing as well as educational skills to create a lasting positive change
              in the body and mind.</p><br>
            <p class="text">By combining elements of classical ballet and modern dance and applying body awareness tools through the use
              of functional, effective movements taught in a simple and joyful manner, this program will lead the participant
              to progressively improve posture, develop flexibility and coordination and increase muscle strength, thus creating
              the basis for efficient and gentle movement.</p>
            <p class="text">Since the current level of this program is intended for beginners, no previous dancing knowledge or experience
              is required.</p><br>

            <p class="text">Jazz Dance is an exciting and ever-evolving dance style full of rhythm and syncopation, that combines techniques
              of classical ballet and modern dance with the current forms of popular dance. Steeped in the rhythm of jazz
              music, a true American art form, jazz dance is an energetic and fun type of dancing, consisting of unique moves,
              fancy footwork, big leaps and quick turns.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Classes include warm-up and stretching exercises, explore body isolations of the head, shoulders, ribcage, feet,
              and arms, and teach diverse dance-style techniques -powerful and percussive or expressive and lyrical-, always
              encouraging individual expression and the development of personal style.</p><br>
            <h4 class="title" id="contemporary">Contemporary Dance</h4><img class="responsive-img" src="images/contemporary.jpg" alt="contemporary">
            <p class="text">Classes are based on modern and contemporary techniques and ideas, with emphasis placed on succession and functionality
              of movement. The program is aimed at developing awareness of the student´s abilities and limitations through
              designed exercises and the use of the body, its flexibility range and the creation of internal connections.
              During the classes, various forms of energy and movement will be addressed. By watching and breathing, focusing
              and connection-making with the body, deliberate and accidental differences and diversity will be discovered.
              The differences within each person, his/her presence and consciousness will connect through the quality and
              embodiment of motion. By means of improvisation and sequences, students will seek various forms of interconnections
              and disconnections. Enhanced body coordination will be achieved through breathing, for being breath and breathing
              the most basic connection of the body that will accomplish the liveliness of movement and a sense of connection
              with other dancers. Succession generated by breath will provide smoothness, but also the desired explosive
              movement. Through exercises and movement combinations (beginning with simpler movements –the ones a person
              performs in everyday life- until mastering more complex and technically demanding movements over time), students
              will be guided to recognize the established connections of the body and explore their possibilities on their
              own terms.</p><br>

            <h4 class="title" id="reshape">Realign & Reshape</h4><img class="responsive-img" src="images/reshape.jpg" alt="fitness">
            <p class="text">Improper posture and body alignment limit body functions and affect many aspects of human health and thus it
              is a concern of everyone, regardless of occupation, activities, environment, body type, gender, or age. Holding
              an inadequate posture and doing movements from a poor alignment position cause greater wear and tear on joints,
              increasing the risk of injury and leading to other health problems that may range from fatigue, sore muscles
              and back pain to spine curvature, subluxations and disability. But it is worth noting that proper body alignment
              is more than just good posture, since many other mechanical principles and body system functioning are involved
              as well. In other words, knowing how to move, sit and stand properly can improve the whole body mechanics and
              help you to move in a manner that is smart and efficient, preventing injuries, and balancing the way your muscle
              groups work. Furthermore, studies have proved that proper posture and alignment are essential for optimal wellbeing
              and functioning of the body, since they help the major systems in the body work better: digestive system, respiratory
              system, nervous system, immune system and more. Briefly said, everything runs better when the body is aligned.</p><br>
            <p class="text">With that in mind, DanzArt’s offers REALIGN & RESHAPE, its new fitness program under the guidance of the professional
              dancer and yoga instructor, Iva Richtermoc, and consisting in a set of corrective physical exercises dosed
              in intensity, type and duration, which are applied to avoid or correct bad posture habits or incorrectness.
              The aim of this program is to increase muscle strength, increase the range of motion and improve movement coordination
              so as to prevent the possible formation or further progression of physical deformities, encourage the restoration
              of correct alignment and learn how to recognize and correct body posture problems. Through stretching, isometric
              and dynamic set of exercises the participant will be guided to reach the required body posture and alignment
              that will keep his/her body moving, sitting, standing, working, exercising, and being active for a long time,
              thus improving the overall health as well.</p><br>

            <p class="text">FlowDancing is not a new technique in dance, but a synthesis of several approaches inspired by classical, modern
              and contemporary dance, yoga, gymnastics, and breathing techniques. </p><br>
            <p class="text">FlowDancing derives its name from the two principal components defining it: dance movements executed through
              the use of the whole body in a never-ending flow, allowing breath to play an important role in the training
              and the body to indulge into the movement.</p><br>
            <p class="text">The class starts with a brief and dynamic warm-up incorporating improvisation skills and a nice and smooth stretching
              through a combination of elements from Hagit Yakira, Limon, Graham, and Horton methods as well as from Joe
              Alegado´s movement language, which is centered on complex hands, arms, legs, and torso coordination. The warm-up
              is followed by a structured floor and across the floor work, moving through the space to explore the freedom
              and spontaneity of movement. The class finishes with a set of static, stretching and breathing exercises to
              calm down and help muscles and ligaments to find their way into the right position.</p><br>
            <p class="text">During the class, technical elements such as alignment, articulation, weight transfer, isolation, balance, and
              arm coordination are explored, with a special emphasis on fluidity and clarity of movement, freedom of expression,
              and improvisation, alowing the participant to improve strenght, endurance, and flexibility, relieve stress,
              and invigorate the mind.</p><br>
