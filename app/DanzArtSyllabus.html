                                    <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ employs various visual teaching methods to assist the visual learner and teach visual learning skills. Each class utilizes a visual schedule to assist the child with sequencing and moving from exercise to
                                        exercise. All personal work areas are clearly designated and color-coded so that children can focus on the exercises and know their personal-space boundaries. All exercises are done in front of mirrors to allow children the
                                        opportunity to see themselves and to correct their movement when necessary. Each class has an accompanying DVD that the students are expected to watch twice a week between classes. The DVD displays all the visual images used
                                        in class to assist with proper ballet technique (i.e. your foot needs to brush the floor with your leg straight in a tendu so the children see a broom taped to a leg with the foot “sweeping” away ash), and shows children doing
                                    each exercise.</p>

                                    <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ utilizes classical ballet music that was specifically composed for each class. All music was composed to assist the auditory learner and to teach the auditory skill of timing (when to move) and what emotion
                                        is being expressed. Likewise, all music was composed to correlate with the images and the story being told in the DVD. As part of the auditory learning process, the teacher sings (instead of speaking or counting out) each exercise
                                    to assist the children in learning the proper combinations.</p>

                                    <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ is primarily based on full body movement. It focuses on every part of the body from facial expressions to the tips of the fingers and toes. There are specific exercises in every class designed to assist the
                                        children in learning to express emotions through facial expressions, learning to feel movement through the tips of their fingers and toes, and learning to work with the spine (how to curve and straighten it). This method also
                                        assists each child in learning body awareness and physical coordination. Also, each class requires various energy levels (depending on the exercise) teaching the children how to regulate their energy levels depending upon the
                                    exercise requirements. Likewise, these exercises teach spatial awareness through the designated spaces on the floor and through combinations completed with other students.</p>

                                    <p class="text">The Schlachte Method™ teaches emotional intelligence through various means. The first step in emotional intelligence is the ability to identify emotions. This method teaches children to identify anger, happiness, sadness, surprise,
                                        etc. through body movements, musicality, and facial expressions. This method also utilizes story to express emotions. Each exercise has a story that corresponds with the movement and emotions. Children will be told the story
                                        and then be taught to express it through movement and facial expression. As part of this method the children will be taught in a safe and structured environment so that they can focus on expressing themselves emotionally without
                                        any anxiety or fear. The DVD works to prime the child so that the child knows exactly what is expected in class to alleviate any surprises. The visual schedule assists with reducing anxiety helping the child know what exercise
                                        is next and when class will be ending. Any changes to the class structure are told to the child beforehand to prepare them for that which is different. Likewise, any sensory distractions in the studio will be minimized to help
                                    the child focus more easily on the ballet instruction.</p>

                                        arms and encourage individual expression and the development of personal style. Jazz dance can be powerful and percussive or expressive and lyrical and is taught with the music of today.</p>

The program is aimed at developing awareness of the student´s abilities and limitations through designed exercises and the use of the body, its flexibility range and the creation of internal connections.
                                            During the classes, various forms of energy and movement will be addressed. By watching and breathing, focusing and connection-making with the body, deliberate and accidental differences and diversity will be discovered. The differences within each person, his/her presence and consciousness will connect through the quality and embodiment of motion. By means of improvisation and sequences, students will seek various forms of interconnections and disconnections.
                                            Enhanced body coordination will be achieved through breathing, for being breath and breathing the most basic connection of the body that will accomplish the liveliness of movement and a sense of connection with other dancers. Succession generated by breath will provide smoothness, but also the desired explosive movement.
                                            Through exercises and movement combinations (beginning with simpler movements –the ones a person performs in everyday life- until mastering more complex and technically demanding movements over time), students will be guided to recognize the established connections of the body and explore their possibilities on their own terms.
