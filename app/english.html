            <p class="item-1">Pohađam satove baleta za početnike. Balet je moj san od djetinjstva, ali uvijek me bilo strah probati i nisam vjerovala da ću ga naučiti u stranoj zemlji, sve dok nisam došla u DanzArt, tako da sam DanzArtu prije svega zahvalna što je donio balet u moj život. 
Satovi su odlično dizajnirani i atmosfera je pozitivna i vrlo zabavna. 
Predavanje je odlično. Irene me uvijek s puno strpljenja ispravlja kad je potrebno i daje mi komplimente kad se napredujem. Irene dobro drži ritam svakog sata, tako da istovremeno osjećam i izazov i motivaciju. Uživam u plesu i vježbi te poboljšavam koncentraciju i pamćenje. Vrlo je ugodno iskustvo učiti plesati balet u DanzArtu pa vam toplo preporučam da nam se pridružite!

            <h3 class="title">Some words from the founder</h3><br>
            <p class="text">“Since my early childhood I have had the fortune and the privilege to learn and practice the amazing and challenging
              art of classical ballet as well as the rewarding and magnificent experience of teaching ballet for almost 12
              years, which can be accounted among the happiest and most gratifying ones in my life. More than a hobby, ballet
              has meant to me a gift, a blessing, a way of understanding and appreciating life.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Simply stated, dance embellishes our life and has the profound power to heal our body, psyche and soul, because,
              as
              <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham">Martha Graham</a></cite> quoted, “…(it) is the
              hidden language of the soul". For some reason, yet in ancient times, Plato and Aristotle assigned a central
              place to dance in educational theory, believing that dance contributes to aesthetic, moral, and intellectual
              values, enhances physical adeptness and overall well-being, and is capable of producing refinement of the mind.</p><br>
            <p class="text">That is why I believe that anyone with the desire to dance, regardless of his or her age, skills, appearance,
              abilities or disabilities, deserves the possibility of experiencing the wonders of dancing to enrich life.
              And, knowing first-hand the goodness and benefits of ballet practice, it is my dream to share and make the
              magic of dance accessible to everyone, even to children and youngsters with special needs.</p><br>
            <p class="text">In DanzArt people of all ages and abilities are welcome to learn and practice ballet and other forms of dance
              in a positive and encouraging environment that instills in students a love and appreciation of the art of dance,
              as well as an enhanced sense of self-worth and accomplishment”.</p><br>
