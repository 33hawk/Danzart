More than a hobby, ballet has meant to me a gift, a blessing, a way of understanding and appreciating life.</p><br><p class="text">Simply stated, dance embellishes our life and has the profound power to heal our body, psyche and soul, because, as <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham">Martha Graham</a></cite> quoted, “…(it) is the hidden language of the soul". For some reason, yet in ancient times, Plato and Aristotle assigned a central place to dance in educational theory, believing that dance contributes to aesthetic, moral, and intellectual values, enhances physical adeptness and overall well-being, and is capable of producing refinement of the mind.</p><br><p class="text">That is why I believe that anyone with the desire to dance, regardless of his or her age, skills, appearance, abilities or disabilities, deserves the possibility of experiencing the wonders of dancing to enrich life. And, knowing first-hand the goodness and benefits of ballet practice, it is my dream to share and make the magic of dance accessible to everyone, even to children and youngsters with special needs.</p><br><p class="text">In DanzArt people of all ages and abilities are welcome to learn and practice ballet and other forms of dance in a positive and encouraging environment that instills in students a love and appreciation of the art of dance, as well as an enhanced sense of self-worth and accomplishment”.</p><br><p class="irene-kuzatko">Irene Kuzatko</p><hr><a href="#0" class="cd-top">Top</a><p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; 2016 DanZart d.o.o.</p></div></li></ul></div></div><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b, o, i, l, e, r) {
