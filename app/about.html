              <br>
              <p class="text">Dance is not just movements of the body and a way to express emotions and to foster imagination and creativity, but it is also a soul-stirring art form that generates harmony with the body, the mind and the spirit and a means to encourage
                discipline, self-esteem and self-confidence.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="text">Being ballet the backbone of many dance techniques and the base from which the total dancer is created, DanzArt’s curriculum is heavily influenced on ballet technique and, as the dancers grow and mature, can be merged with modern dance styles
                such as Jazz and Contemporary Dance, being its main objective to train students how to get body awareness and muscle control, how to improve posture, mental acuity, physical prowess and flexibility, how to move their bodies correctly and
                safely, and, most importantly, how to enjoy movement and music.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="text">DanzArt Studio Zagreb is specialized in dance and movement training based on ballet fundamentals for all ages and abilities, by means of diverse teaching programs that range from creative movement for 3 years olds through various young and
                adult programs, including a teaching method specifically developed for children with special needs.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="text">More than a studio, DanzArt is a family gathered in a special place of enjoyment, growth, and support. Let DanzArt take you to the magical journey of art and dance and to discover and develop new abilities!</p>

              <h3 class="title">Philosophy</h3>
              <h4 class="subtitle">No exclusion</h4>
              <p class="text">Dance is well known as a special aid for developing mind, body, and spirit and an optimal means to express feelings and canalize emotions. That is why DanzArt team believes that, no matter the skills, abilities or disabilities, sex or age,
                EVERYONE should be given the opportunity to experience the joy of dance and the benefits of disciplining the mind and body through this form of art.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Best effort and high quality training</h4>
              <p class="text">It is also DanzArt’s strong belief that anything worth doing is worth doing right, and that even less talented students shall be taught to pursue excellence to the best of their abilities. Consistent with this believe, DanzArt encourages
                and inspires each student to their very best effort, and in return, provides the care, direction, and attention each student deserves. But in order to demand effort, commitment and excellence from dancers, it is imperative to provide quality
                instruction and a strong foundation in dance which they will surely apply in whatever manner they wish as they pursue their lives.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Discipline through dance</h4>
              <p class="text">Danzart believes as well that through the structured and disciplined dance training, students will learn about music, rhythm and beat, gain a better understanding of spatial relationships, learn to think with both sides of their brain, develop
                creative thinking skills and increase their ability to push themselves to higher achievements. These skills will enhance the student´s academic performance as well as their physical well-being. Self-discipline, self-motivation, self-confidence
                and self-esteem will develop as each dancer conquers new movements and grows more certain of his or her ability to work hard and master new steps, enabling the student not only to take chances, meet new challenges, and reach higher goals,
                but to excel in everyday life.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Confidence and cooperative work through performance</h4>
              <p class="text">Danzart further believes that dance is a performing art and is meant to be shared. Performing gives students the confidence they need to succeed in a professional career of any kind, but also teach them the cooperative teamwork necessary
                to produce a high quality work of art.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Dance is joy and fun</h4>
              <p class="text">And, most importantly, DanzArt believes that dance is joy and thus strives to make dance training fun and enjoyable and to translate every training session not only in an educational and challenging experience, but in a pleasant and memorable
                moment, capable of building in students love and passion for the art of dance.</p>
