            <h3 class="subtitle">Irene Kuzatko</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Born in Caracas, Venezuela, to Croatian parents, Irene began dancing at the age of 3 and was trained by some of the most
              prestigious ballet teachers in Venezuela. Through her teenage years she became entirely dedicated to ballet,
              but at the age of 18 she decided to pursue other interests, obtaining a BA degree in Translation and Interpretation
              in Spanish, English, and French from the Central University of Venezuela, the country’s most renowned university.
              Years later she obtained another degree, this time as Lawyer, graduating Summa Cum Laude from the same Alma
              Mater, and thereafter two Master Degrees in Family and Children Law and Procedure Law. Nevertheless, during
              her studies and professional career both as translator and lawyer, her love and joy for dancing never faded
              and she managed to combine her professional life with ballet practice and to teach Ballet and Jazz to children
              and teenagers for over 15 years.
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">
              In 2012 she decided to move with her family to Zagreb and to pursue her dream of running a dance studio, so as to recreate
              her magnificent experience of teaching ballet and materialize her desire to share and make the magic of dance
              accessible to everyone, even to children and youngsters with special needs. With this goal in mind, more recently
              she obtained a Specialization Degree in Teaching Fundamentals and completed two certification programs in Ballet
              Teaching Methods for Children with Special Needs -Psycho-Ballet (a Cuban Method) and the Schlachte™ Method
              (a North American Method developed by Bonnie Schlachte)-.
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">
              Dance has been a huge part of Irene’s life and, since her own growth as an individual came from the world of Ballet, she
              looks forward to sharing her passion for Ballet and all the knowledge and benefits gained through this form
              of art.
