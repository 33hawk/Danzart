                DanzArt is a beautiful dance studio, full of light and good vibes. Ballet is my hobby, my love and my passion. I first came
                to DanzArt last July (2016) to attend summer intensive classes. Since then it became my very special happy
                place, my second home. From last September I am attending Ballet C1 (Beginners) classes, as well as Barre
                á terre and Body-Barre classes. Teachers are great and very passionate about their work with us. Every class
                is challenging both for body and mind. The atmosphere is a working one but always full of joy and great fun.
                Since last September I made a progress I never have thought is possible, thanks to my inspiring and encouraging
                teachers and my great classmates.</p>

                I 've joined DanzArt since May of 2016, and I have fallen in love with dance, particularly ballet. It took one moment, a
                choice to let my guard down and try something outside of my comfort zone, and I couldn't be happier with
                my decision. The instructors at DanzArt are kind hearted and dedicated to their students. Their passion is
                reflected in their dancers. DanzArt is my home, my place to be free, to work on myself in maintaining a healthy
                lifestyle and to pursue a new passion. It's a place where I can be a new me, a better me. I thank DanzArt
                from the bottom of my heart for giving me this opportunity to expose a graceful, more elegant side in me
                that I never knew existed. I recommend DanzArt to everyone, no matter the age, gender, experience, etc. Come
                to DanzArt, you will be welcomed with open arms in our family of dancers.</p>

                I'm attending ballet class for beginners. Ballet is a dream since my childhood, but I was always afraid to try and I had
                never imagined that I would learn ballet in a foreign country until I met DanzArt. So first of all I'm very
                grateful that DanzArt brought ballet to my life. The course is very well designed and the class atmosphere
                is quite positive with a lot of fun. Teaching is brilliant. Irene always correcting me when necessary with
                lots of patience and giving compliments when I get improved. Irene keeps the pace of each class very well,
                so I feel challenged and motivated at the same time. It's not just to enjoy dancing and workout, but also
                good for training concentration and memory. It is a highly enjoyable experience to learn ballet dancing with
                DanzArt, and I heartily recommend you to join us!</p>

                I have never been in such a quality ballet studio in Zagreb. Their priority is to teach students how to dance and enjoy dancing...
                What amazes me most is how fully dedicated teachers are to helping students learn and improve their dancing
                skills and the commitment and energy they exhibit while explaining and teaching... They put in a lot of effort
                and you can notice it from the moment you walk in the studio... You progress really fast and every second
                of the class makes you a better dancer...</p>

                I never dreamed that I would start dancing ballet as an adult, but it happened. And DanzArt was the best place I could have
                chosen to do so. All teachers are wonderful educators and dancers themselves and the choice of classes is
                plenty. It allows me to create my own dance schedule that can fit into my obligation-packed daily routine.
                I love dancing at DanzArt. But what I love the most is the feeling of warmth and family I get every time
                I walk through the door and see Irene’s smiling face.</p>

                A few months ago I started ballet at DanzArt studio. I never did ballet in my life before, just practiced Taekwondo for more
                than 10 years. I came to DanzArt because a friend of mine recommended the studio and also because I wanted
                to do some sport again. One ballet class was sufficient to start dancing.<br> I would recommend
                to anybody this combination of hanging out, anti-stress therapy and good workout!</p>

                I signed up for Body-Barre class in September 2016 for recreational reasons, since I didn’t work out for a year. But I gained
                so much more than recreation. In a relaxed and positive atmosphere Body-Barre trainer, Ida Janković, morphed
                my body into the best that it can be. My strength increased very fast as well as my flexibility. Previous
                back pains are completely gone and my posture is so much better. Ida keeps every training interesting and
                ads new elements to match our growing abilities in the group. Her focus is always on a good posture and preventing
                injuries which makes her an excellent trainer.<br> I would recommend Body-Barre to everyone.
                Just come and try it… you won’t be sorry.</p>

                I came to DanzArt for a month this summer (2017) to continue my dance studies during my short term stay in Zagreb. I’ve been
                traveling (and dancing) through Europe for the past several months and I can say, without question, that
                the instruction at DanzArt is the best I’ve come across so far. The teachers take their adult students seriously,
                and work carefully with them to develop a path towards improvement. The quality of the instruction itself
                is amazing. The students at the school welcomed me right away and made me feel at home. It was a wonderful
                experience and I miss it now that I’ve had to leave Zagreb. I’m planning on coming back to dance at DanzArt
                as soon as I possibly can. Thank you Irene for your dedication to fabulous dance instruction in Croatia.</p>
