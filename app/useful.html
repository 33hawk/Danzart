                            <p class="text">Ballet is taught as a practice comprised of "positions" and traditional steps set to music, which almost anyone can start out learning to do and marks the beginning of body awareness, muscular control, and powerful, poised, physical
                                deportment. The training programs will almost certainly transform the way of standing and holding the body, as dancers will be taught to keep the head up high, to properly position the spine and hips, to put the correct amount
                            of weight on the feet, to improve balance, coordination and flexibility, and to move in a light and fluid manner.</p>
                            <p class="text">Ballet is both a challenging and fulfilling body discipline that develops coordination and mental acuity as well as an ear for music and the joy inherent in responding physically to it. From an exercise standpoint, ballet is beneficial
                                at any age and is a safe form of exercise, whose many benefits include muscular strengthening, the building of cardiovascular stamina, and the potential to increase flexibility. An absolute benefit includes postural awareness,
                                postural alignment and general physical improvement. Because of the isometric techniques employed across ballet study, students of all ages build elongated yet strong arms and legs and the use of the weight of the body against
                            gravity also strengthens lean muscle tissue.</p>
                            <p class="text">Regarding emotional and cognitive benefits, it has been proven that the study of ballet mentors students to develop skills of determination and agility, and helps to build self-confidence. Ballet also enhances grace, and the discipline
                                of its movements and practice promotes the tendency towards excellent organizational skills, develops impressive concentration levels, superior understanding of commitment, artistry and creativity, the propensity for self-expression,
                            exceptional physical fitness, and the noticeable development of cooperation and awareness of other skills.</p>
                            <p class="text">Studying ballet additionally challenges the mind in that it enhances memorization capacity, sequencing skills and sense of self in space – spatial and kinesthetic awareness– thanks to the application of stringing steps together,
                            turning and level changing, reversing and retrograding, all of which can greatly improve dyslexia as well.</p>

                            <h3 class="title" id="value">The Value of Ballet to all Types of Dancers</h3>
                            <p class="text">The dance world today is comprised of many dance styles, but whether you study hip-hop, contemporary or jazz, there is always something you can learn from a ballet class to incorporate into your other techniques. Considered the
                                most demanding and disciplined of all dance forms, ballet provides the foundation for all other dance styles. With a solid ballet foundation, ballet-trained dancers can transfer their skills into jazz, modern dance, or any
                                other style they might decide to pursue. Even in the case of some dance styles that demand a more released technique, such as hip-hop, knowing the opposing technique will enhance the movement quality and create a more versatile
                            dancer. That is why the international trend nowadays is to encourage dancers to incorporate ballet lessons as part of their dance curriculum so as to increase their ability to perform in all dance genres.</p>
                            <p class="text">Below are some of the many values that ballet delivers to dancers of any style:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text">- Develops strength and flexibility through its stylized and controlled movements and positions, which ultimate helps creating a centered, balanced, lengthened and physically graceful dancer.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Requires great physical and mental control.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Improves flexibility, posture and balance.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Allows greater body awareness and control.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Strengthens ankles, legs, and core, especially in the abdominals and lower back area and footwork gains precision and speed.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Shapes alignment, aesthetic purity of line and grace.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Due to its linear movements, it emphasizes form, extension, and lightness in the body.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Its structural technique has a defined form and general class outline that develops coordination of both sides of the body.</p>
                            <p class="text">- Trains the dancer´s musicality and sense of rhythm and tempo, enhancing his/her ability to understand different movement qualities in the body and to adapt to more complex rhythms in other styles.</p>

                                    <td class="text">Ballet is an interpretation of music. Ballet may tell a story, express a mood, or simply reflect the music. Ballet dancers are taught from the very first class how to interpret the mood of the music and/or story of that
                                    music. Through the Schlachte Method™ children are taught how to physically affect certain emotions through facial/body mime.</td>

                                        and other cues. Thus the children reap the benefits of improvements to their self-confidence and self-esteem by learning a culturally valuable skill. By participating in dance classes, not only does the child gain the
                                    immediate benefits of dance, but also get opportunities for socialization and connection within the community.</td>

                            <img class="responsive-img" src="images/WholeChildIntegration.jpg" alt="child_integration">
                            <p class="text">Whole Child Integration refers to the body and mind benefits a particular activity, in this case ballet learning through the Schlachte Method™, brings to every child, no matter his/her abilities or disabilities, by developing and
                                enhancing specific physical and mental skills that feed reciprocally one another and integrate to form a whole functional being. In other words, dance encompasses the whole child, because movement activates the neural wiring
                                throughout the body, making the whole body the instrument of learning. All aspects of development – neurophysiological, emotional, motor, cognitive, perceptual, social, aesthetic and metacognitive - affect all the others and
                            must be integrated with motor development when children attempt to communicate creatively through movement expression.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text"> When learning ballet through the Schlachte Method™, the entire brain is involved and both brain hemispheres are impelled to work as students are instructed to exercise both sides of the body and to think about the whole body. Additionally,
                                through various sensory inputs (visual, auditory, tactile, etc.), and the observation, planning, execution, and repetition of movements accompanied by music, ballet assists with motor planning, increases body awareness, improves
                                the vestibular system (balance and movement), enhances proprioceptive skills (body position and where the child is in relation to others, in the room and how his body is moving) and contributes with sensory integration (interpretation,
                            processing, and integration of sensory stimulus using different senses and whole body involvement).</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text"> In addition, classical ballet technique requires rising onto the balls of the feet or toes, turning out the leg at the hip socket and sustaining high leg extensions to the front, side and back, among other physical manoeuvres.
                                Constant repetition of these exercises not only develop gross and fine motor skills, but also enhances flexibility and builds considerable strength in specific areas, most notably in the hip, abdomen, lower leg, ankle and foot.
                                Since ballet exercises require the use of good posture and alignment, ballet helps to promote good posture and create awareness of good alignment. As core and abdomen muscles are developed and strengthened through ballet practice,
                            balance and coordination are improved as well. Said improvement in balance and coordination allow children to better run and play, thus enhancing their self-confidence and social skills.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text">Ballet learning also involves memory skills and sequencing, since it compels children to memorize steps and perform sequences of movements, allowing students to do complex moves by walking through steps slowly (breaking down the
                            moves into smaller steps), encode the steps (names), repeat and practice sequencing (this step/activity first and then this other step/activity).</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text">Concerning emotional intelligence and social skills, it is known that ballet also requires a lot of concentration and focus. When taking a ballet class, the student needs to be aware of the many specific movements of the hands
                                and feet that are being learned, to concentrate on each movement and the placement of the legs and arms. This increased focus helps the child to improve attention span and listening skills, to self-regulate, to decrease inappropriate
                                behaviors, and to be patient and disciplined. Ballet study helps children to develop new skills and to realize what their body and mind are capable of and that they are able to accomplish something that seemed very difficult
                            at the beginning, which involves as well gaining self-confidence.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text">Furthermore, ballet classes and performances provide the child a context in which to socialize, to share experiences, to learn and practice skills in relating to others (by learning ballet etiquette or participating in collaborative
                            activities, for example), and to activate “mirror neurons”, which play a role in helping a person to understand the behaviors of others, to learn new skills by imitation and to increase empathy.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text">Also, being ballet not only a form of exercise but also an artistic expression, it helps to relieve stress and promotes creative expression. The focus and concentration required to execute the movements relaxes the mind. With the
                            aid of imagery, stories, sounds, words and games, ballet also teaches and encourages the child to express feelings and emotions by means of facial expressions, gestures and body movements.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text">To ease and make enjoyable the process of learning ballet and the acquisition of the above described skills that make possible the whole child integration, the Schlachte Method™ employs diverse teaching tools (visual, auditory,
                                vestibular, tactile, and emotional means) through the use of DVDs with set curricula, pre-established classroom rules and routines, space delimitation, visual schedules, props, specially-composed music, sequenced movement learning,
                            body and facial mimes, mirrors, interactive activities, stories and games, the assistance of trained volunteers, verbal and physical prompts, behavioral modification techniques, etc.</p>
