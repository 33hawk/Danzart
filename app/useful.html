            <img class="float-pics" src="images/facts.jpg">
            <p class="text">Ballet is taught as a practice comprised of "positions" and traditional steps set to music, which almost anyone
              can start out learning to do and marks the beginning of body awareness, muscular control, and powerful, poised,
              physical deportment. The training programs will almost certainly transform the way of standing and holding
              the body, as dancers will be taught to keep the head up high, to properly position the spine and hips, to put
              the correct amount of weight on the feet, to improve balance, coordination and flexibility, and to move in
              a light and fluid manner.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Ballet is both a challenging and fulfilling body discipline that develops coordination and mental acuity as well
              as an ear for music and the joy inherent in responding physically to it. From an exercise standpoint, ballet
              is beneficial at any age and is a safe form of exercise, whose many benefits include muscular strengthening,
              the building of cardiovascular stamina, and the potential to increase flexibility. An absolute benefit includes
              postural awareness, postural alignment and general physical improvement. Because of the isometric techniques
              employed across ballet study, students of all ages build elongated yet strong arms and legs and the use of
              the weight of the body against gravity also strengthens lean muscle tissue.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Regarding emotional and cognitive benefits, it has been proven that the study of ballet mentors students to develop
              skills of determination and agility, and helps to build self-confidence. Ballet also enhances grace, and the
              discipline of its movements and practice promotes the tendency towards excellent organizational skills, develops
              impressive concentration levels, superior understanding of commitment, artistry and creativity, the propensity
              for self-expression, exceptional physical fitness, and the noticeable development of cooperation and awareness
              of other skills.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Studying ballet additionally challenges the mind in that it enhances memorization capacity, sequencing skills
              and sense of self in space – spatial and kinesthetic awareness– thanks to the application of stringing steps
              together, turning and level changing, reversing and retrograding, all of which can greatly improve dyslexia
              as well.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="title" id="value">The Value of Ballet to all Types of Dancers</h3>
            <p class="text">The dance world today is comprised of many dance styles, but whether you study hip-hop, contemporary or jazz,
              there is always something you can learn from a ballet class to incorporate into your other techniques. Considered
              the most demanding and disciplined of all dance forms, ballet provides the foundation for all other dance styles.
              With a solid ballet foundation, ballet-trained dancers can transfer their skills into jazz, modern dance, or
              any other style they might decide to pursue. Even in the case of some dance styles that demand a more released
              technique, such as hip-hop, knowing the opposing technique will enhance the movement quality and create a more
              versatile dancer. That is why the international trend nowadays is to encourage dancers to incorporate ballet
              lessons as part of their dance curriculum so as to increase their ability to perform in all dance genres.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Below are some of the many values that ballet delivers to dancers of any style:</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">- Develops strength and flexibility through its stylized and controlled movements and positions, which ultimate
              helps creating a centered, balanced, lengthened and physically graceful dancer.</p>
            <p class="text">- Requires great physical and mental control.</p>
            <p class="text">- Improves flexibility, posture and balance.</p>
            <p class="text">- Allows greater body awareness and control.</p>
            <p class="text">- Strengthens ankles, legs, and core, especially in the abdominals and lower back area and footwork gains precision
              and speed.</p>
            <p class="text">- Shapes alignment, aesthetic purity of line and grace.</p>
            <p class="text">- Due to its linear movements, it emphasizes form, extension, and lightness in the body.</p>
            <p class="text">- Its structural technique has a defined form and general class outline that develops coordination of both sides
              of the body.</p>
            <p class="text">- Trains the dancer´s musicality and sense of rhythm and tempo, enhancing his/her ability to understand different
              movement qualities in the body and to adapt to more complex rhythms in other styles.</p>

                <td class="text">Through the Schlachte Method&trade; ballet is taught through a visual means and the sequences are repeated
                  every single class. Classes consist on a set curriculum that does not change. Once a child learns how to
                  complete one movement, said movement is built upon to learn the next movement. The sequences are taught
                  methodically and slowly, thus behaviors mastered are built upon like adding links to chained repertoires.
                  Overall there are benefits in sequential memory and recall, focus and staying on task, increased self-discipline,
                  and extended visual, physical, and mental attention. </td>

                  neuro-typical people. </td>
                <td class="text">Ballet dancers develop the "mirror system" in their brains through the repetition of ballet movements. The
                  mirror system becomes so strong that an injured dancer can just look at a video of a ballet and be able
                  to maintain their skill while injured. Taking ballet classes may enhance a part of the brain that needs
                  development in children that have special needs.</td>

                  way. Teaching a person with special needs social graces is like coaching an actor for a play. Every step
                  needs to be planned.
                </td>
                <td class="text">Ballets are based on the works of Shakespeare and classic myths and fairy tales. Ballet dancers are taught
                  to express emotions - anger, fear, jealousy, joy, and sadness- through their bodies and facial expressions.
                  Considering that the first step in emotional intelligence is recognition of the basic emotions and the
                  differences among them, the Schlachte Method™ teach children how to recognize and express emotions by imitating
                  facial expressions.</td>

              <tr>
                <td class="text">Because children with special needs may have difficulty generalizing, they tend to learn better using visual
                  task analysis by breaking down all the steps of an activity and need as well specific concrete steps to
                  complete tasks. One of the most common and proven interventions for teaching children with special needs
                  is through Discrete Trial Training. </td>
                <td class="text">Each ballet movement is based on a set "vocabulary" and is taught by breaking down every individual component
                  of the entire movement. In other words, each dance/movement has a visual task analysis. The Schlachte Method&trade;
                  teaches all ballet technique using visual task analysis through which every ballet movement is split into
                  small concrete visual steps. </td>

                  their energy levels. Vigorous aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce self-injurious behaviors and aggression
                  in children with special needs. </td>
                <td class="text">Ballet exercises the entire body evenly. In each ballet class, there is a portion in which dancers practice
                  allegro movements (brisk, lively, and fast movements) that are very demanding, but also fun for children
                  to do. The Schlachte Method&trade; uses images based on fairy tales and in many of the exercises the children
                  are focused on "pretending" to be the leprechaun or a Jack-in-the-box and do not realize how hard they
                  are exercising.

              <tr>
                <td class="text">It has been shown that sensory-based information is the most powerful sensation humans have and is what the
                  brain uses to naturally learn and to regulate. The most powerful input in terms of activating the brain
                  is in movement and whole body involvement. Therefore, children with special needs learn best in settings
                  where they are able to utilize their whole body in movement to learn a task. </td>
                <td class="text">Every movement in ballet utilizes the student's entire body (from the toes to the legs, hips, torso, head,
                  and all the way to the finger tips).That is why participating in ballet class gives children the ability
                  to activate their brain naturally through whole body movement. The Schlachte Method&trade; ensures as well
                  that the student is being taught through every means of learning: kinetically, visually, auditory, and
                  verbally. </td>

                <td class="text">Every ballet class utilizes the mirror as a main teaching tool. Children look at themselves throughout the
                  class to adjust their movements or see where their bodies are in the space. Over time, the repetition of
                  doing movements in front of the mirror strengthens the child's body awareness. The Schlachte Method&trade;
                  also utilizes squares on the floor so that the children can learn personal space boundaries and internalize
                  that skill over time. There are overall benefits to hand-eye coordination, physical strength, and balance.

                <td class="text">The only way children may learn is by watching ballet dancers' dance, and not by reading a book or being
                  verbally told how to execute a move. Ballet dancers learn by watching others and themselves (via the mirror).

              <tr>
                <td class="text">Children with special needs often need highly structured teaching. A highly structured classroom with set

                <td class="text">Ballet is a very structured art form with specific techniques and rules for each movement. Each ballet class
                  has a set curriculum that is followed in every single class. Even the general context of the class is ritualized
                  (from putting the ballet attire and warming up to the barre and center work, enchainment, etc.). Again,
                  the Schlachte Method&trade; uses visual schedules and always does the class in sequence of the DVD, so
                  children understand the structure of the class and what is expected. This lessens children’s anxiety and
                  allows them to focus more on the actual learning of the craft.</td>

                  “tendu”.) New movements are taught on the foundations already known to the student. Through visual schedules
                  and a set curriculum, the Schlachte Method&trade; gives the children a means of what to expect, so they
                  can learn to plan and anticipate.

              all the others and must be integrated with motor development when children attempt to communicate creatively
              through movement expression.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text"> When learning ballet through the Schlachte Method™, the entire brain is involved and both brain hemispheres are
              impelled to work as students are instructed to exercise both sides of the body and to think about the whole
              body. Additionally, through various sensory inputs (visual, auditory, tactile, etc.), and the observation,
              planning, execution, and repetition of movements accompanied by music, ballet assists with motor planning,
              increases body awareness, improves the vestibular system (balance and movement), enhances proprioceptive skills
              (body position and where the child is in relation to others, in the room and how his body is moving) and contributes
              with sensory integration (interpretation, processing, and integration of sensory stimulus using different senses
              and whole body involvement).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text"> In addition, classical ballet technique requires rising onto the balls of the feet or toes, turning out the leg
              at the hip socket and sustaining high leg extensions to the front, side and back, among other physical manoeuvres.
              Constant repetition of these exercises not only develop gross and fine motor skills, but also enhances flexibility
              and builds considerable strength in specific areas, most notably in the hip, abdomen, lower leg, ankle and
              foot. Since ballet exercises require the use of good posture and alignment, ballet helps to promote good posture
              and create awareness of good alignment. As core and abdomen muscles are developed and strengthened through
              ballet practice, balance and coordination are improved as well. Said improvement in balance and coordination
              allow children to better run and play, thus enhancing their self-confidence and social skills.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Ballet learning also involves memory skills and sequencing, since it compels children to memorize steps and perform
              sequences of movements, allowing students to do complex moves by walking through steps slowly (breaking down
              the moves into smaller steps), encode the steps (names), repeat and practice sequencing (this step/activity
              first and then this other step/activity).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Concerning emotional intelligence and social skills, it is known that ballet also requires a lot of concentration
              and focus. When taking a ballet class, the student needs to be aware of the many specific movements of the
              hands and feet that are being learned, to concentrate on each movement and the placement of the legs and arms.
              This increased focus helps the child to improve attention span and listening skills, to self-regulate, to decrease
              inappropriate behaviors, and to be patient and disciplined. Ballet study helps children to develop new skills
              and to realize what their body and mind are capable of and that they are able to accomplish something that
              seemed very difficult at the beginning, which involves as well gaining self-confidence.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Furthermore, ballet classes and performances provide the child a context in which to socialize, to share experiences,
              to learn and practice skills in relating to others (by learning ballet etiquette or participating in collaborative
              activities, for example), and to activate “mirror neurons”, which play a role in helping a person to understand
              the behaviors of others, to learn new skills by imitation and to increase empathy.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Also, being ballet not only a form of exercise but also an artistic expression, it helps to relieve stress and
              promotes creative expression. The focus and concentration required to execute the movements relaxes the mind.
              With the aid of imagery, stories, sounds, words and games, ballet also teaches and encourages the child to
              express feelings and emotions by means of facial expressions, gestures and body movements.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">To ease and make enjoyable the process of learning ballet and the acquisition of the above described skills that
              make possible the whole child integration, the Schlachte Method™ employs diverse teaching tools (visual, auditory,
              vestibular, tactile, and emotional means) through the use of DVDs with set curricula, pre-established classroom
              rules and routines, space delimitation, visual schedules, props, specially-composed music, sequenced movement
              learning, body and facial mimes, mirrors, interactive activities, stories and games, the assistance of trained
              volunteers, verbal and physical prompts, behavioral modification techniques, etc.</p>

            <h3 class="title" id="ballet-adults">Why Ballet for Adults</h3>
            <img class="float-pics" src="images/balletadults.jpg">
            <p class="text">It is a fact that all over the world more and more adults of all ages are taking ballet lessons nowadays because
              of the tremendous benefits in terms of health and emotional well-being that ballet practice brings with it.
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">The truth is that adult ballet classes offer an altogether different reward than a promising dance career; it
              is like exercise for people who hate exercise, stimulating not only your body, but also your mind, creativity,
              and spirit. It’s a way to do fun regular exercise and focus your mind purely on your body.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Being a dance studio specialized in Ballet, DanzArt offers a beginner ballet class specifically designed for
              adults of all ages with little or with no previous dance experience with the goal of slowly and methodically
              focusing on sound postural alignment, learn the basics of ballet and reap all the extraordinary benefits that
              this art form brings with its practice.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Not convinced yet? Want to know more about the wonders ballet can do to your body, mind and spirit? </p><br>
            <p class="text">From the physical point of view, ballet is a great way to keep fit. In ballet, every inch of your muscles is
              actively engaged in movements. Actually, ballet is one of the best workouts to not only strengthen, tone, and
              sculpt your entire body without bulking, but also to improve flexibility, coordination and body awareness. You
              will be so busy trying to stand up straight, turn out your feet and feel the music that you won't even realize
              how much you're exercising. Bring on the élevés and relevés to work the lower extremities, especially the calves,
              ankles and feet, and you too will start seeing results that no other workout can accomplish. </p><br>
            <p class="text">Another benefit of ballet is that it constantly works on alignment and does wonders to your posture. As the basic
              requirement of ballet is to have a neutral stance with the spine straightened and hips "squared" (meaning,
              parallel on both sides), this posture is going to have a "spill-over" effect on your day-to-day posture and
              will eventually strengthen your back, butt and abdominal muscles. This alignment work will also improve the
              vestibular system, which could ease balance problems and chronic dizziness.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Now focusing on the mind and soul, some choose ballet for its high "fun factor". In ballet you get to move along
              with music and make beautiful patterns with your bodies. Ballet dancers use a lot of "brain power" to remember
              the steps and to coordinate the different body parts. For example, dancers exercise the left brain for getting
              the "mathematical" parts - the logic of the step combinations - ; the right brain for interpreting the music
              and expressing our body in an artistic manner; the upper rear portion of the brain for interpreting spatial
              relationships; and the lower part of the brain for memorizing the steps. Briefly stated, for being such a neurologically
              complex activity, ballet develops mental acuity and improves concentration levels and memory skills and is
              considered a useful method for staving off memory loss and managing degenerative conditions such as dementia
              and Parkinson’s.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Additionally, studies have confirmed that classical music, which is commonly used in ballet lessons, stimulates
              the alpha waves in the brain –those detected when the mind is calm or in the meditative and intuitive states-
              therefore enhancing thinking, learning and intuition. As a direct result, dancers’ musicality is also likely
              to improve over time, as they learn to move their body with music instead of just counting the beats.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Concerning artistry, ballet is a highly aesthetic art and has the magic of making you get completely absorbed
              in it, encouraging additionally your poise, grace, elegance, musicality, confidence, and artistic expression.
              It is also about process as much as performance and there will always be a new subtlety to master; the joy
              of moving in time to music; the comfort of familiar patterns repeated and refined.</p><br>
            <p class="text">Whether or not you have danced before, DanzArt’s Adult Ballet classes will make you reap all of the above benefits
              and achieve amazing things. What is sure is that, by the time you leave the class, your wellbeing will be improved,
              you will stand an inch taller, and you will look more poised, full of energy and like the nerves of your fingers
              and toes have thanked you!</p>

            <h3 class="title" id="six-reasons">6 Reasons Dance Training Makes Us Better Human Beings</h3>
            <img class="float-pics" src="https://assets.rbl.ms/11147805/1200x800.jpg">
            <p class="text">Everyone knows that training is the cornerstone of a successful career in dance. But as a dance educator, I also take comfort in the fact that high-quality dance training helps shape students into genuinely good people (in addition to creating future artists, which is a wonderful goal in itself.) These are the lessons dance teaches that help make students into better humans:
            </p><br>
            <p class="text strong">Improvement Takes Commitment Over Time</p>
            <p class="text">In my tap courses at Cal State University, sometimes students are shocked when they can't learn something quickly. In today's world, we're used to getting fast results. You need an answer—Google it. You need to talk to someone—text them. The cooking channel wants your dinner to be easy, the physical trainer wants your workout to be five minutes, Rosetta Stone can have you speaking Mandarin in an hour.</p><br>
            <p class="text">But dancers know that even when you have aptitude, there's no substitute for hard work and perseverance. Acquiring any skill of value takes time. It's the way we learn to dance, to play music, to speak a foreign language, to succeed academically, to change social norms and to break down barriers. We lace up our shoes day after day, week after week, year after year and learn how to dance. Commitment over time is the very antithesis of modern living and is at the core of dance training.</p><br>
            <p class="text strong">"Failures" Are Opportunities</p><br>
            <p class="text">At the foundation where I work that gives low-cost dance lessons to underserved kids, we do assessments to place students in the appropriate level. Every year we remind the kids that in academic schooling not moving up to the next grade every year is seen as a failure but in the arts, it is normal to stay in a level for multiple years as you perfect your skills. Every year there are kids who don't move up and are upset. But they soon realize that moving to the next level comes with mastery of a certain set of techniques and mastering those techniques takes hard work.</p><br>
            <p class="text strong">You Don't Get Something For Nothing</p><br>
            <p class="text">In dance class you are only entitled to what you earn. And what you earn doesn't even necessarily have to be perfect dance technique. Some of my favorite students over the years have not been the best tap dancers but they've been magnificent students. They show up on time and are prepared, they work hard, they sweat and they persevere. Maybe they don't become the most skilled dancer in the room, but they often reap the most benefits. And here is the beautiful part: those kids have worked hard exactly because they don't have a feeling of entitlement.</p><br>
            <p class="text strong">We Are Accountable to Ourselves and Each Other</p><br>
            <p class="text">At the foundation where I teach we have a very strict wardrobe policy. Any student not properly dressed sits and observes class that day. It may seem overly harsh, but there's wisdom behind it. There might be a time that a dancer or their family forgets the uniform, but it doesn't happen again. Over time, as the dancer matures, they learn to be responsible without the parents being involved, and you no longer hear "My mom forgot my shoes."</p><br>
            <p class="text">Dancers also become responsible for learning the material. They learn that the teacher is not a puppet master who can make a body do the correct thing; it is up to the student to learn the material. They learn that they are responsible to the rest of the class, and that being absent lets down their classmates because other dancers can't get in a good practice without everyone in the room. Missing class, coming to class unprepared or not focusing on executing the steps properly, they learn, affects everyone else.</p><br>

Over time, as the dancer matures, they learn to be responsible without the parents being involved, and you no longer hear "My mom forgot my shoes."</p><br>
            <p class="text strong">Cutting Corners Isn't An Option</p><br>
            <p class="text">My younger students will invariably ask me when they can move to the next level and my answer is very frustrating to them, I'm sure. I say that there is really only one level: beginning. If everything goes well in the beginning, improvement will flow. If any corners are cut, it will be hard to become advanced. I distill advanced steps down to the same words I use for a person's first tap lesson. Anyone with an aptitude for dance who excelled a little too quickly will tell you that they eventually go back to fill in the gaps.</p><br>
            <p class="text strong">What Other People Think Doesn't Matter</p><br>
            <p class="text">In a world that is so concerned about appearances, dance teaches you that what others think is not the most important thing. I try to explain to my young students that they can't let their experiences get derailed by what they think someone else may be thinking. If they stand front and center in class and make a mistake, what does it matter what another student thinks? Stand in front, get that correction, improve because you want to and let someone else's view be damned. Let those too lethargic to meet their potential stand in the back and watch you strive to be better. If you can't do it today, there is always next class and you are already on the way because you have begun.</p><br>
